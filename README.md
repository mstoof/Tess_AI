# Virtual Artificial Intelligence Assistant: Tess

Tess is an open-source personal assistant who can live on your server. 

The main functions are very basic up until now, they will be expanded when I have more time to work on it. 

Upcoming updates include:
* Fully Functional AI concepts
* Being able to run on a Server
* Create more Skills for Tess


## What can Tess do?
Today most of the tasks are fairly basic, but will be expanded later.

* Send Emails
* How is the weather
* News
* Search on Google
* Play some basic music
* Answer what the Time is
* Shutdown your PC.
